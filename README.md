This glossary is [reference](https://diataxis.fr/reference/) documentation that is intended to guide Orcfax design and development.
That means the glossary terms must be comprehensive, unambigous, as well as semantically and logically consistent with all other terms in the glossary.

The Orcfax docs site contains more detailed [explainer](https://docs.orcfax.io) documentation that is better meant for stakeholders to understand Orcfax concepts and objectives.
