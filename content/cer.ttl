    skos:definition '''
      The feed type representing Currency Exchange Rate feeds.
      This includes feeds such as ADA-USD and FACT-ADA.

      ### Naming convention

      For a feed of CER type, the naming convention is
      `{{base-currency}}-{{quote-currency}}` and ordering
      follows forex convention (see [base-quote](#baseQuote)).

      Fiat currency names follow ISO 4217.

      Currency names are stripped of `/` and any non-standard
      characters.

      For crypto base currencies, ordering defers to how the
      pairs appear on CEXs.

      For cardano native tokens, ordering defers to how pairs
      appear on DEXs.

      Examples
      * crypto-fiat: `ADA-USD`
      * crypto-stable: `ADA-iUSD`
      * crypto and another native asset: `FACT-ADA`
