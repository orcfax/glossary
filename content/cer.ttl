    skos:definition '''
      The feed type representing Currency Exchange Rate feeds.
      This includes the feeds ADA-USD and FACT-ADA.
      For a feed of CER type, the feed name naming convention is 'base currency second'.
      For example: for the case of crypto-fiat `ADA-USD`; crypto-stable `ADA-iUSD`; crypto-base and other native asset `FACT-ADA`.
      Beyond this, there is not yet precedence on ordering.
