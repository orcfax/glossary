      The feed type representing Currency Exchange Rate feeds.
      This includes the feeds ADA-USD and FACT-ADA.

      ### Naming convention

      For a feed of CER type, the feed name naming convention is `{{cur-a}}-{{curr-b}}`,
      where the ordering follows the forex convention of 'base currency second' (see [base-quote](#baseQuote)).
      Currency names of fiat follow ISO 4217.
      For crypto base currencies, we defer to how it appears on CEXs.
      For cardano native tokens, we defer to how it appears on the main DEXs.
      For example: for the case of crypto-fiat `ADA-USD`; crypto-stable `ADA-iUSD`; crypto-base and other native asset `FACT-ADA`.

      Beyond this, there is not yet precedence.
      Currency names should stripped of `/` and any non-standard characters.
      Ordering will be fleshed out as it arises.
