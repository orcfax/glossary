    skos:definition '''
      The identifier of a feed within a feed type which is
      selected to globally unique.

      Together with the feed type, the feed name determines the
      feed id. A short uppercase list of ASCII characters is
      preferred, for example `ADA-USD`.

      Each feed type will have its own naming convention.
