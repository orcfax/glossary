    skos:definition '''
      Code executed by Cardano nodes when accepting txs.
      A plutus script, or simply script when the context is clear, governs:
      the spending from the associated payment address;
      the minting (and burning) of associated tokens;
      withdrawals from the associiated staking account _etc_.
      A tx will be rejected from the ledger if the script errors.
      The hash (blake2b_256) of the script determines the associated tokens and credentials.
