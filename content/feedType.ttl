    skos:definition '''
      Each feed has exactly one feed type, which are used to
      group feeds into semantically similar sets.

      Two feeds of the same type will share statement body
      datatypes, and have the same visualisations etc.

      For example, the feed type `CER`
      (Currency Exchange Rate feeds) includes the feeds ADA-USD
      and FACT-ADA.

      Each feed type has short, uppercased, label (eg `CER`).
      This appears as the first part of  the feed ID.
