    skos:definition '''
      Each feed has exactly one feed type.
      Feed types group feeds to semantically similar sets.
      Two feeds of the same type will share statement body datatypes, and have the same visualisations etc.
      For example the feed type `CER`, the Currency Exchange Rate feeds, includes the feeds ADA-USD and FACT-ADA.
      Each feed type has short, uppercased, label (eg `CER`).
      This appears as the first part of  the feed id.
