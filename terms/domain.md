# Domain
A domain is the targeted subject area for a software-intensive system.

It is the sphere of knowledge and activity around which the software's processes, rules, and data revolves.

[Domain-driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) (DDD) is a software development methodology wherein the terms an and concepts of the business domain can be directly traced to software modules and artifacts. 

A "ubiqutious language" is used across all layers of the domain so that product owners, end-users, and developers can more clearly communicate requirements and deliver an application that works as expected.
