# Cardano

[Cardano](https://cardano.org) is a third-generation Layer 1 blockchain platform that addresses the limitations of previous designs through a combination of a robust PoS consensus mechanism, a layered approach separating settlement and computation, and the use of formal methods to ensure security and correctness.

Of particular note is Cardano's Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model, which extends Bitcoinâ€™s UTXO model by allowing more complex scripts and metadata to be attached to transactions.

Cardano uses the Ouroboros Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol to achieve consensus. Ouroboros is designed to be secure, scalable, and energy-efficient. 

Ouroboros divides time into epochs and slots. Each slot has a leader responsible for adding a block to the blockchain. Slot leaders are randomly chosen using a multi-party computation (MPC) process.

ADA is Cardano's native token. Stakeholders can delegate their ADA to staking pools to participate in the consensus process and earn rewards.

Cardano uses a Haskell-based language called Plutus to program smart contracts.
