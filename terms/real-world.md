The material world as experienced by humans in their conciousness.

There are many philosophical, scientific, and religious theories on the how the real world originated and how it operates. For the sake of providing focus to the software design of a blockchain oracle, the definition of "real world" is scoped here to match the four dimenstions in the Theory of Relativity. 

The real world combines three dimensions of space with one dimenstion of time. Anything that happens within this four-dimensional grid is called an event. Oracles provide data about real-world events to blockchain smart contracts.
